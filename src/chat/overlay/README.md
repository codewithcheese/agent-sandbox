# AI Agent File Management System: High-Level Specification

## 1. Overview

This specification describes a system that enables an AI agent to read and modify files while providing users with a 
staging and review mechanism before changes are applied. The system operates as a middleware layer between the AI agent 
and the actual file system, accumulating proposed changes and allowing users to review, approve, or reject them through 
a visual diff interface.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Core Components

* **Change Tracking System**: Records and represents file operations
* **Change Accumulator**: In-memory staging area for pending changes
* **File System Overlay**: Virtual layer that mediates access to files
* **Diff Viewer**: UI component for reviewing pending changes
* **Conflict Resolution System**: Handles divergences between staged and disk versions

### 2.2 User Experience Flow

1. User interacts with AI agent, requesting file operations
2. Agent performs file reads through the File System Overlay
3. Agent proposes file modifications which are captured by the Change Tracking System
4. Changes are accumulated but not immediately applied to files
5. User can review changes in the Diff Viewer
6. User approves or rejects changes, potentially selectively
7. Approved changes are committed to the actual file system

## 3. Component Specifications

### 3.1 Change Tracking System

#### 3.1.1 Capabilities

* Track atomic file operations: create, modify, delete, rename
* Capture metadata including: change ID, conversation turn, timestamp, description
* Associate changes with their originating conversation messages
* Support reverting changes if conversation messages are deleted

#### 3.1.2 Change Record Structure

* Operation type (create/modify/delete/rename)
* File path information (path for standard operations, old and new paths for renames)
* Content snapshots (before/after states for content-modifying operations)
* Metadata (ID, timestamp, conversation turn, originating message ID)
* Description of the change in human-readable form

### 3.2 Change Accumulator

#### 3.2.1 Responsibilities

* Maintain one composite change record per file path
* Implement merging logic for sequential operations on the same file
* Provide efficient querying of pending changes by path
* Support efficient pruning of changes by message ID

#### 3.2.2 Merging Rules

1. First change on a file establishes the baseline "before" state
2. Subsequent changes update only the "after" state and metadata
3. Create followed by delete results in cancellation (no change)
4. Delete followed by create becomes a modify operation
5. Create followed by modify remains a create operation
6. Any sequence involving rename updates the file path key

#### 3.2.3 Capabilities

* Add changes and automatically merge with existing changes
* Retrieve all staged file paths
* Retrieve accumulated change for a specific path
* Calculate the effective content for a file after applying all pending changes
* Discard changes by ID or by message ID
* Apply selected changes to the file system

### 3.3 File System Overlay

#### 3.3.1 Responsibilities

* Provide a unified view of files that includes pending changes
* Deliver the most up-to-date content to the agent (staged version if it exists)
* Detect and handle conflicts with file system changes made outside the agent
* Mediate all file read/write operations

#### 3.3.2 File Read Behavior

* When reading a file that has pending changes:

    * Return the latest staged version that includes all pending changes
    * Attempt lazy reconciliation if disk version has changed
    * Surface conflicts to the agent when automatic reconciliation fails
* When reading a file with no pending changes:

    * Return the current disk version

#### 3.3.3 File Write Behavior

* Capture write operations as change records
* Add to the Change Accumulator instead of modifying files directly
* Link changes to the originating conversation message

#### 3.3.4 Reconciliation Algorithm

* Compare the base snapshot with current disk version
* If identical, no reconciliation needed
* If different, attempt automatic three-way merge:

    * Base = original "before" snapshot
    * Ours = agent's "after" version
    * Theirs = current disk version
* On successful merge, update the staged version
* On failure, mark as conflict and provide conflict resolution options

### 3.4 Diff Viewer

#### 3.4.1 Responsibilities

* Display visual diff between disk version and staged version
* Indicate conflicts when they occur
* Support approval/rejection of changes at file or change level
* Refresh automatically when staged changes update

#### 3.4.2 Display Requirements

* Side-by-side or inline diff visualization
* Highlight insertions, deletions, and conflicts
* Show metadata including description and timestamp
* Support binary files with appropriate visualization

### 3.5 Conflict Resolution System

#### 3.5.1 Conflict Types

* **Text Conflict**: Disk version differs from base snapshot, cannot automatically merge
* **Deletion Conflict**: File deleted on disk but has pending changes
* **Creation Conflict**: File created on disk that was supposed to be created by agent
* **Rename Conflict**: File renamed on disk while pending changes exist

#### 3.5.2 Resolution Options

* Accept agent version (force overwrite)
* Accept disk version (discard agent changes)
* Perform manual merge (edit conflict markers)
* Delegate back to agent (request regeneration based on current state)

## 4. Edge Cases and Special Considerations

### 4.1 Message Deletion

* When a conversation message is deleted, all changes originating from that message should be automatically pruned
* The diff view should update immediately to reflect the current state after message deletion
* If message deletion leaves no pending changes for a file, it should be removed from the staged list

### 4.2 External File Modifications

* System must detect when files change outside the agent's control
* Attempt automatic reconciliation when possible
* Surface conflicts to the user with clear resolution options
* Prevent data loss by never silently overwriting changes

### 4.3 File Deletions and Renames

* Handle files deleted outside the agent's control by treating as conflicts
* Track file identity beyond path to handle external renames
* Provide appropriate resolution options for deletion conflicts

### 4.4 Concurrent Agent Sessions

* Support multiple concurrent chat sessions with the agent
* Consider centralized change store to prevent conflicts between sessions
* Track which session generated which changes
* Ensure changes from one session are visible to other sessions

### 4.5 Binary Files

* Provide appropriate handling for non-text files
* Store only change metadata, not full binary content
* Use appropriate visualization for binary diffs

## 5. Safety Requirements

### 5.1 Data Loss Prevention

* Never silently overwrite user changes made outside the agent
* Perform safety checks before committing changes to ensure base state matches
* Provide conflict detection and resolution to prevent overwrites
* Support selective application of changes

### 5.2 Transparent Decision Making

* Clearly show what changes will be applied
* Provide descriptions of what each change does
* Allow inspection of both current and proposed states
* Make conflict detection visible and understandable

### 5.3 Reversibility

* Support discarding changes before they're applied
* Allow selective rejection of specific changes
* Support pruning changes when conversation messages are deleted

## 6. Persistence and Recovery

### 6.1 Change Persistence

* Consider persisting pending changes to survive application restarts
* Store change records with all relevant metadata
* Handle recovery gracefully, including conflict detection on startup

### 6.2 Orphaned Changes

* Detect when base snapshots no longer match any existing file
* Provide appropriate handling for orphaned changes (discard or mark as conflicts)
* Clean up accumulated changes appropriately when they become irrelevant

## 7. Performance Considerations

### 7.1 Memory Usage

* Optimize storage of change records for large files
* Consider using references or deltas rather than full content snapshots
* Handle large numbers of pending changes efficiently

### 7.2 Responsiveness

* Ensure diff rendering is responsive even for large files
* Optimize reconciliation algorithms for performance
* Consider background processing for expensive operations

## 8. Integration Points

### 8.1 Agent Integration

* Provide a clear API for the agent to read and write files
* Ensure the agent always sees the current effective state (disk + pending changes)
* Surface conflicts to the agent in a way it can reason about

### 8.2 File System Integration

* Abstract the underlying file system operations
* Handle platform-specific behaviors consistently
* Support appropriate error handling for file system operations

### 8.3 User Interface Integration

* Provide hooks for updating UI components when changes occur
* Support efficient rendering of diffs
* Enable interactive conflict resolution

## 9. Implementation Approach

A suggested implementation approach would follow these phases:

1. Implement the core data model and accumulator logic
2. Build the file system overlay with read/write capabilities
3. Create the diff viewer component
4. Implement agent tool integration
5. Add apply/discard workflow
6. Support edge cases (rename, delete)
7. Add multi-session support
8. Implement persistence
9. Polish the user experience

Each phase should be testable independently to ensure correct behavior before proceeding.
