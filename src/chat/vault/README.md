# AI Agent File Management System: Git-Based Implementation

## 1. Overview

This specification describes a system that enables an AI agent to read and modify files while providing users with a 
staging and review mechanism before changes are applied. The system leverages git's versioning capabilities through 
isomorphic-git, creating an efficient middleware layer between the AI agent and the actual file system. This approach 
allows for accumulating proposed changes in memory and enabling users to review, approve, or reject them through 
a visual diff interface.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Core Components

* **Git-Based Version Control**: Uses isomorphic-git to track file operations
* **In-Memory File System**: Volatile filesystem (memfs/LightningFS) for staging changes
* **File System Overlay**: Union filesystem that prioritizes staged changes over disk files
* **Diff & Merge System**: Git's native diff and merge capabilities
* **Conflict Resolution System**: Handles divergences between staged and disk versions

### 2.2 User Experience Flow

1. User interacts with AI agent, requesting file operations
2. Agent performs file reads through the File System Overlay (unionfs)
3. Agent proposes file modifications which are captured in the in-memory filesystem
4. Changes are committed to a staging branch but not immediately applied to disk files
5. User can review changes using git's diff capabilities
6. User approves or rejects changes, potentially selectively
7. Approved changes are merged from the staging branch to the main branch and applied to the actual file system

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1 File Operations

#### 3.1.1 Capabilities

* Track atomic file operations using git commands:
  * Create/modify: add, writeBlob, commit
  * Delete: remove, updateIndex, commit
  * Rename: Similar to git's rename tracking
* Associate changes with conversation messages through git commits and refs
* Support reverting changes if conversation messages are deleted through git's branching capabilities

#### 3.1.2 Implementation Mapping

* **Create/Modify/Delete/Rename**: Maps to git commands (add, remove, updateIndex, writeBlob, writeTree, commit, renameBranch)
* **Change Metadata**: Stored in commit messages and refs
* **Message Association**: Each turn creates a commit tagged with the message ID
* **Reversion**: Reset or drop commits when a chat message is deleted

### 3.2 In-Memory Staging

#### 3.2.1 Approach

* Use a volatile filesystem that only the agent sees
* Work in a throw-away branch (ai/staging) inside the volatile filesystem
* Do not flush to disk until approval

#### 3.2.2 Message Grouping & Undo

* Commit each conversation turn on the staging branch
* Tag commits with message IDs using git.writeRef('refs/notes/chat/...')
* Reset or drop commits when a chat message is deleted using git.updateRef
* Operations are practically instant because objects live in RAM

#### 3.2.3 Overlay Reads

* Mount unionfs with priority: `ufs.use(memVol).use(fs)`
* Agent always reads the latest staged view
* Real filesystem is only accessed when changes aren't present in memory

### 3.3 Diff & Merge

#### 3.3.1 Capabilities

* Use `statusMatrix` for fast file-level change detection
* Three-way merge with `diff-3` for reconciling changes
* Pluggable `mergeDriver` for custom reconciliation logic

#### 3.3.2 Conflict Handling

* Detect conflicts with `merge({ abortOnConflict:false, dryRun:true })`
* Returns `MergeConflictError` with list of conflicted files
* Provides flexibility to surface conflicts to users or auto-resolve them

### 3.4 Selective Apply

#### 3.4.1 Approach

* After approval, checkout the real filesystem
* Cherry-pick the staged commits or copy blobs
* Delete the volatile branch
* Works like a transaction - all or nothing

## 4. Implementation Benefits

### 4.1 Technical Advantages

* **Pure JavaScript**: No native modules required
* **Cross-platform**: Runs in Node, Deno, browsers, Web Workers, Electron
* **Mature Technology**: Leverages git's battle-tested versioning capabilities
* **Efficient**: In-memory operations are fast and lightweight
* **Familiar Model**: Uses git's well-understood branching and merging model

### 4.2 User Experience Benefits

* **Transparent Changes**: Clear visualization of proposed modifications
* **Granular Control**: Approve or reject changes at various levels of detail
* **Reliable Undo**: Easy reversion of changes tied to conversation messages
* **Conflict Awareness**: Early detection and resolution of potential conflicts

## 5. Implementation Notes

This git-based approach provides a practical implementation of the AI Agent File Management System using established version control concepts. While it deviates somewhat from the original component-based specification, it achieves the same core functionality through git's native capabilities, potentially reducing development complexity and leveraging a mature ecosystem.
